Challenge level: Medium

Davis has a number of staircases in his house and he likes to climb each staircase 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time. Being a very precocious child, he wonders how many ways there are to reach the top of the staircase.
Given a height of a staircase n, find the different numbers of ways there are to reach the top if you can only climb 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time.
