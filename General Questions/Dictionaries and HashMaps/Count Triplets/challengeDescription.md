Challenge level: Medium

You are given an array and you need to find number of triplets of indices (i, j, k) such that the elements at those indices are in geometric progression for a given common ratio r and i < j < k.

For example, arr = [1, 4, 16, 64]. If r = 4, we have [1, 4, 16] and [4, 16, 64] at indices (0, 1, 3) and (1, 2, 3), respectively.
