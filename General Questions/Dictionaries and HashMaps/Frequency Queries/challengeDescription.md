Challenge level: Medium

You are given q queries. Each query is of the form of two integers, described below: 
- 1 x: Insert x in your data structure. 
- 2 y: Delete one occurence of y from your data structure, if present. 
- 3 z: Check if any integer is present whose frequency is exactly z. If yes, print 1 else 0.

Return an array of integers where each element is a 1 if there is at least one element value with the queried number of occurrences in the current array, or 0 if there is not. (The array is made up of the results for every '3' query checks)
