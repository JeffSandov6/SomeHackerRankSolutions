Challenge level: Medium

A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than  and itself. Given  integers, determine the primality of each integer and print whether it is Prime or Not prime on a new line.

Note: If possible, try to come up with an O(sqrt(n)) primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you can come up with for an O(n) algorithm
