Challenge level: Hard

Consider an undirected graph consisting of n nodes where each node is labeled from 1 to n and the edge between any two nodes is always of length 6. We define node s to be the starting position for a BFS. Given a graph, determine the distances from the start node to each of its descendants and return the list in node number order, ascending. If a node is disconnected, it's distance should be -1.
