Challenge level: Medium

You are planning production for an order. You have a number of machines that each have a fixed number of days to produce an item. Given that all the machines operate simultaneously, determine the minimum number of days to produce the required order. The order is represented as a 'goal' value. It can be thought of as a total number of iterms that we want produced. Given that every machine in the input array represents the time each machine takes to produce 1 item, we want the minimum number of days it'll take to make all the items.

EX: machines[1, 3, 4]. These 3 machines are represented as:
- machines[0] produces 1 item every day
- machines[1] produces 1 item every 3 days
- machines[2] produces 1 item every 4 days
