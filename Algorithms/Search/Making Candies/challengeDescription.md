Challenge level: Hard

Karl loves playing games on social networking sites. His current favorite is CandyMaker, where the goal is to make candies.

Karl just started a level in which he must accumulate n candies starting with m machines and w workers. In a single pass, he can make m*w candies. After each pass, he can decide whether to spend some of his candies to buy more machines or hire more workers. Buying a machine or hiring a worker costs p units, and there is no limit to the number of machines he can own or workers he can employ.

Karl wants to minimize the number of passes to obtain the required number of candies at the end of a day. Determine that number of passes.
