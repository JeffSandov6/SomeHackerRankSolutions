This is the classic, find the largest rectangle in a histogram problem, just worded a little differently.

Skyline Real Estate Developers is planning to demolish a number of old, unoccupied buildings and construct a shopping mall in their place. Your task is to find the largest solid area in which the mall can be constructed.

There are a number of buildings in a certain two-dimensional landscape. Each building has a height, given by h[i], where i = [1, ..., n]. If you join k adjacent buildings, they will form a solid rectangle of area:
k * min(h[i], h[i+1], ..., h[i+k-1]
